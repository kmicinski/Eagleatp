The Eagle Logic System / ATP
Kristopher Micinski, 2007.
----------------------------

This is the Eagle, a simple Logic system and Automated Theorem
prover for first order logic. This directory contains much of the
source for the current branch of Eagle in development.

Eagle started in 2006 as a simple prover for first order logic
and was written entirely in C. I (Kris Micinski) Never released
The 0.1.0 or 0.2.0 versions of the system. Currently Eagle is
being rewritten in SML and is in 0.3.0, which includes a much
more flexible logic system, as well as allowing multiple styles
of proof. This allows for proof by hand, e.g. Sequent calculi,
as well as more automated proofs.
